# DeepSet

## Pytorch-Modules for construction of DeepSet architectures and DeepDoubleSetNetwork - DDSN

## Future Work:

1. Cython-extention for faster processing of nessecary for-loops. 
2. Option for iterative transferlearning process
  3. Train each vectorization network separately to allow more streamlined dataloading and
     easier utilzation of GPU parallelization options.
